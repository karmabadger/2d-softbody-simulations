so I added a grid factory that can generate grids of particles of rows x cols
there are all the functions needed in there.

the boolean var spring_debug, if true then will draw spring and particles
if false then will draw the actual shape instead.


takes around 30 secs to load up
might need to adjust k depending on how large the thing is
